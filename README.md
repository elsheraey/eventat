This repository showcases my participation in various technical events like hackathons, webinars, etc. including brief descriptions of the challenges tackled and the solutions proposed during each event.

## IBM Digital - Nation Competition for Egypt (Jul 2019 - Oct 2019)

IBM Digital - Nation Competition for Egypt was held under the auspices of the Egyptian Ministry of ICT in collaboration with ITI (MCIT’s technical delivery arm) & AmCham Career Development Center to address critical environmental issues such as air pollution, water pollution, etc.

Our team had made it to the fourth stage of the competition with our idea, TrashMoney, though we didn't proceed to the final pitch due to a lack of novelty.

During the fourth stage, I earned all badges on the IBM Digital - Nation Africa platform becoming its top learner at the time earning me the chance to speak about my experience on the competition's closing day on Saturday, October 26, 2019.

## Code Geist (Jul 2019)

Code Geist is Egypt’s first Hackathon for undergraduates organized by [SefrWahed](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sefrwahedegypt), which follows the standards of any typical hackathon where the event lasts for 72 hours, and for the first time in Egypt with the participation of 200 enlightened students, from more than 30 different educational institutions.

Our team, Shwarma Endeavour, was shortlisted among ~48 competing teams with our project, Colab Lite, a web-based collaborative editor, built to improve educational experiences that involve programming. 

I led the team's efforts through the application, screening pitch, development, and final pitch and even though we didn't really win in the normal sense, it marked our team's first participation in a hackathon and it was a memorable experience.
