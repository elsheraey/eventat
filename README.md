This repository showcases my participation in various technical events like hackathons, webinars, etc. including brief descriptions of the challenges tackled and the solutions proposed during each event.

## Code Geist (Jul 2019)

Code Geist is Egyptâ€™s first Hackathon for undergraduates organized by [SefrWahed](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sefrwahedegypt), which follows the standards of any typical hackathon where the event lasts for 72 hours, and for the first time in Egypt with the participation of 200 enlightened students, from more than 30 different educational institutions.

Our team, Shwarma Endeavour, was shortlisted among ~48 competing teams with our project, Colab Lite, a web-based collaborative editor, built to improve educational experiences that involve programming. 

I led the team's efforts through the application, screening pitch, development, and final pitch and even though we didn't really win in the normal sense, it marked our team's first participation in a hackathon and it was a memorable experience.
