## NASA Space Apps (Oct 2019)

NASA Space Apps is an international hackathon for coders, scientists, designers, storytellers, makers, builders, technologists, and others in cities around the world, where teams engage with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s free and open data to address real-world problems on Earth and in space.

Our team, Sand and Water, was shortlisted among ~120 teams out of ~550 registered teams with our project, Rising Sand, a web-based geographical information system or GIS with augmented reality or AR sandbox display aiming at helping users visualize the cumulative impacts of rising sea levels and act proactively towards the issues of climate change.

## IBM Digital - Nation Competition for Egypt (Jul 2019 - Oct 2019)

IBM Digital - Nation Competition for Egypt was held under the auspices of the Egyptian Ministry of ICT in collaboration with ITI (MCIT’s technical delivery arm) & AmCham Career Development Center to address critical environmental issues such as air pollution, water pollution, etc.

Our team had made it to the fourth stage of the competition with our idea, TrashMoney, though we didn't proceed to the final pitch due to a lack of novelty.

During the fourth stage, I earned all badges on the IBM Digital - Nation Africa platform becoming its top learner at the time earning me the chance to speak about my experience on the competition's closing day on Saturday, October 26, 2019.

## DevFest GDG Cloud Egypt (Sep 2019)

There was some interesting speakers from Google on this day, and it was the first time I got introduced to Firestore and Qwiklabs, where I could get hands-on experience with the Google Cloud for practice, which paid off a ton later on during my working experience.

## Code Geist (Jul 2019)

Code Geist is Egypt’s first Hackathon for undergraduates organized by [SefrWahed](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sefrwahedegypt), which follows the standards of any typical hackathon where the event lasts for 72 hours, and for the first time in Egypt with the participation of 200 enlightened students, from more than 30 different educational institutions.

Our team, Shwarma Endeavour, was shortlisted among ~48 competing teams with our project, Colab Lite, a web-based collaborative editor, built to improve educational experiences that involve programming. 

I led the team's efforts through the application, screening pitch, development, and final pitch and even though we didn't really win in the normal sense, it marked our team's first participation in a hackathon and it was a memorable experience.

## AmCham Egypt 17th Employment Fair (Jul 2019)

I've attended this purely for fun to get to know more about Employment Fair activities and was happy to consult lots of HR professionals on how to perfect one's resume and push through the screening phases.

## [AMECSE](http://2018.amecse-conferences.org/) (Dec 2018)
